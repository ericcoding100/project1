NOTE: If you had used a different password or port number for your MySQL server, remember to change the credentials inside the UserServlet.java file and RegisterServlet.java files.


Inside your UserServlet.java file, change the URL port number from 3306 to your MySQL port number that you configured. Change the jdbcPassword from ‘password’ to your configured password.
 

Inside your RegisterServlet.java file, change the URL port number from 3306 to your MySQL port number that you configured. Change the jdbcPassword from ‘password’ to your configured password.
